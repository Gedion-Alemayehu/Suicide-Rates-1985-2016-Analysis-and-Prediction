# Suicide-Rates-1985-2016-Analysis-and-Prediction
Raw data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning for a predictive model. 
If for instance, a country wanted to lower their suicide rates it would have to take into
consideration some variables that contribute to the rates and perhaps analyze other countries in
the world that face the same problem and analyze some commonalities and differences to help
them approach the problem. In this process, it would imperative to set a goal and finding the
variables with high correlation to predict the rate in the future and compare it with their
solutions. My project is to help find the best correlation between a variable and the suicide rate to
help better predict the future rates, simultaneously identifying the most conducive problem
contributing to suicide, consequently narrowing a possible target for a solution.
After exploring multiple data-set sources, I ended up using Kaggle as my data source.
The data set that I chose is the Suicide Rates Data Set. There are multiple reasons why I chose
this data set. Evidently, suicide is a pertinent and perennial problem on a global basis. Especially
in the western world. The contents of this data set are pretty bulky and detailed. The data set
contains the recorded suicide number in 101 countries from 1985 to 2016. It presents us with
multiple variables as columns to add more detail about the recorded suicides; accordingly, it
entails 12 factors: the country where it was recorded, the population of each country, the gross
domestic product of each country, the human development index of each country, the age group
of each record, the generation to which each record belongs to, and the sex for each record. It
presents alternative representations for some of these factors for further clarification, for
instance, it comprises suicide number per 100 thousand in addition to the total population to
represent each country in a fair manner by countering their differences in the total population.
